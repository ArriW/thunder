# Thunder's Week 8: First Full Week
**Monday, July 14 – Sunday, July 20, 2025**  
*(Building on Susan Garrett's homecoming weekend foundation)*

## 🧠 Susan Garrett's Purpose:
Continue the consistent daily routine that teaches Thunder:  
**crate → potty → training → crate**,  
while using **classical conditioning** to build positive associations and **high-rate reinforcement** to prevent problems before they start.

> 📘 **Need a full crate-training protocol?** See the dedicated [Crate Training Guide]({{ "/crate-training/" | relative_url }}) for step-by-step introduction games, overnight routine, and troubleshooting. Use it alongside the schedule below.

> 🚽 **Potty specifics** (signals, accelerated method, overnight strategy) live in the [Potty Training Guide]({{ "/potty-training/" | relative_url }}). Follow its rules while executing the schedule here.

## 🔑 Susan Garrett's Foundational Rules:
- **Crate = Good**: Calm, predictable, **reward-rich**—never punishment  
- **Earn Your Freedom**: All freedom or play must be **earned by potty success**
- **75/25 Feeding**: 75% of daily kibble through training, 25% in bowl
- **Classical Conditioning**: Make everything Thunder needs = "good"
- **Prevention Over Correction**: Structure prevents problems
- **Be a PEZ Dispenser**: High-rate reinforcement for new behaviors

---

## ⏱️ Daily Visit Flow (3x Daily with Susan's Games)

### 1. **Arrival → Potty First (Susan's Cue Conditioning)**
- Quietly open crate and take Thunder **straight to his potty zone**
- Use **"potty, potty, potty"** cue as he eliminates
- Wait up to 3–5 minutes

#### ✔️ If Thunder pees:
- **"Yes!"** the moment he finishes + high-value treat
- **Be a PEZ Dispenser**: 3-4 rapid treats for success
- Proceed to supervised training session

#### ❌ If Thunder doesn't pee:
- Calmly return him to the crate for 10–15 minutes  
- **Try again** after that window
- **No training until successful potty**

> 💬 "No wee, no play." – Steve Mann + Susan Garrett's "Earning Freedom" philosophy

### 2. **Susan's Training Games (15–25 min)**

When potty is successful, provide **structured, confidence-building games** with 75% of meal portion:

#### 🎲 Susan's 5 Games - Week 8 Progression:

**Game 1 - Training is Fun (Advanced):**
- Throw treats in crate **while Thunder is out** → he runs in to get them
- Build **"crate" cue**: point to crate → Thunder enters → "Yes!" → treat toss
- Goal: Thunder **chooses** to go to crate when pointed

**Game 2 - Name Recognition (Duration):**
- "Thunder!" → eye contact → **"Good" (duration marker)** for 2-3 seconds → "Yes!" → treat
- Add movement: "Thunder!" from different positions in room
- **Never repeat** the name - one cue, one response

**Game 3 - This Place (Bed/Mat Targeting):**
- Place mat 3 feet away → "place" → Thunder goes to mat → "Yes!" → treat on mat
- Build **duration**: "place" → Thunder settles → "good...good..." → "break!" → release
- **Goal**: 10-second settled stay on mat

**Game 4 - Break/Release Word:**
- "Break" = permission to move from any position
- Practice: sit → "good...good..." → "break!" → play
- **Essential** for preventing frustration

**Game 5 - Four on Floor (Impulse Control):**
- Hold treats visible → Thunder sits automatically → "Yes!" → treat
- **No jumping** for attention, food, or greetings
- If Thunder jumps → treats disappear → try again

#### ✅ Equipment Conditioning Games (Week 8):
**Grooming Tools Conditioning:**
1. **Brush in bowl** → treats → targeting brush
2. **Brush touches body** → "Yes!" → treat
3. **One brush stroke** → "Yes!" → treat
4. **Build to 5 strokes** without stress signals

**Leash/Collar Advanced:**
1. **Clip leash on** → "Yes!" → treat → **immediately remove** → play continues
2. **Repeat 3-5 times** per session (prevent terminal association)
3. **Build duration**: leash on for 30 seconds → 1 minute → 2 minutes

---

### 3. **Crate Return → Susan's Method**
- **Wind down** with 2-3 calm pets
- **Pre-load crate** with frozen KONG (part of 25% bowl portion)
- **"Crate"** cue → Thunder enters → "Yes!" → second chew item
- **Close door calmly** - no fanfare or goodbye rituals
- **Crate = jackpot location**

---

## 📅 Week 8 Susan Garrett Specific Goals

### Monday-Tuesday: Equipment Mastery
- **Collar/leash conditioning**: No resistance to handling
- **Brush game**: 5 strokes without stress
- **Name response**: 9/10 times with eye contact
- **Crate cue**: Enters on first request

### Wednesday-Thursday: Prevent Terminal Associations
- **Visitor protocol**: Guest arrives → treats → guest leaves → more treats (prevent "guests = fun ends")
- **Car conditioning**: In car → treats → out of car → play continues
- **Sound desensitization**: Vacuum sound → treat scatter during entire sound

### Friday-Sunday: Advanced Confidence
- **Extended training sessions**: 20-25 minutes with multiple games
- **Chained behaviors**: "Thunder" → sit → "place" → "break" sequence
- **Public introduction**: Carrier rides with positive associations

## 🚫 Susan's Problem Prevention Strategy

### Attention-Seeking Prevention:
- **Never respond** to whining, barking, or pawing for attention
- **Only reward calm behavior** - be boring when Thunder is demanding
- **Teach "quiet" cue**: When Thunder stops barking → "quiet" → "Yes!" → treat

### Bite Inhibition (Susan's Backup Plan):
- **Consent to console**: Practice gentle restraint with treat rewards
- **Collar grab game**: Hold collar gently → "Yes!" → treat → release
- **Redirect to appropriate chews** immediately

### Terminal Association Prevention:
- **Rehearse endings**: Put leash on → treat → remove leash → continue playing
- **Practice departures**: Pick up keys → treat → put keys down
- **Visitor protocol**: Guest arrives → treat party → guest stays → more treats

## 📘 Susan Garrett Principles Applied:

### "Everything is Either Good, Bad, or Meaningless"
- **Make it Good**: Use treats, play, attention to condition positive responses
- **Avoid Bad**: Never punish, scold, or create fear associations  
- **Eliminate Meaningless**: Every cue should predict something great

### "Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure"
- **Structure prevents problems** before they develop
- **High-rate reinforcement** builds confidence faster than correction
- **Rehearse endings** to prevent terminal associations

### "My Puppy is Doing Their Best"
- **Adjust environment** if Thunder struggles
- **Increase reinforcement rate** rather than repeating commands
- **Build on success** rather than correcting failure
