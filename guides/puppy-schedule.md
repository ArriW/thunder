# Thunder's Week 1–2 Puppy Visit Protocol  
*(Structured for working households, enriched with Steve Mann's training principles)*

## 🧠 Purpose:
Create a consistent daily routine that teaches Thunder:  
**crate → potty → play → crate**,  
while preventing accidents and building calm confidence.

---

## 🔑 Foundational Rules:
- Crate is home base: **calm, predictable, neutral—not punishment**  
- All freedom or play must be **earned by potty success**
- Unstructured pen time is **not allowed** unless directly supervised
- Passive chews (e.g. frozen KONGs) are for **crate time only**

---

## ⏱️ Visit Flow (3x Daily)

### 1. **Arrival → Potty First**
- Quietly open crate and take Thunder **straight to his potty zone**
- No fuss, no play, no eye contact on the way  
- Wait up to 3–5 minutes

#### ✔️ If Thunder pees:
- Deliver **calm but genuine praise** (treat optional)
- Proceed to supervised play session

#### ❌ If Thunder doesn't pee:
- Calmly return him to the crate for 10–15 minutes  
- **Try again** after that window

> 💬 "No wee, no play." – Steve Mann's core toilet training rule  
> The potty opportunity *unlocks* everything that follows.

---

### 2. **Supervised Engagement (10–20 min)**

When potty is successful, provide **low-arousal, confidence-building activities** in a gated area:

#### ✅ Great Options:
- **Short tug-of-war** (gentle and structured)
- **Training games**: name recall, sit, touch, follow
- **Calm object games**: fetch, find the toy
- **Exploration**: rotating textures and safe items
- **Body awareness**: stepping over broomsticks, standing on balance pads

#### ❌ Avoid:
- Unstructured chewing (KONGs, lick mats)
- Hyperactivity (e.g. over-chasing, squeakers)
- Unclear boundaries (e.g. roaming)

> 🧠 Steve Mann emphasizes quality over quantity:  
> A few well-structured minutes builds more trust than 30 minutes of "mayhem and hope."

---

### 3. **Crate Return → Calm & Rewarded**
- Wind down with calm petting or stillness
- Pre-load crate with:
  - A **frozen KONG**
  - **Safe chew** item
- Gently guide Thunder back in, **no fanfare or goodbye rituals**
- Crate = place of **reward, not withdrawal**

---

## 🕓 Between Visits
- Puppy is **only crated**, not in the pen
- Enrichment items allowed:
  - Frozen KONG, chew
  - Optional water bowl if vetted

---

## 📋 Tracking Per Visit
- Potty: ✅ or ❌
- Mood: Calm, energetic, overstimulated
- Training progress: name, sit, crate entry
- Crate return: resistance? whining? calm?

---

## 🎯 End of Week 2 Milestones:
- Understands potty → freedom chain
- Comfortable being re-crated without protest
- Recognizes name and comes when called
- Accepts crate enrichment and settles alone

---

## 📘 Reference Principles (Steve Mann-Style):
- **"Don't rush freedom. Teach your pup how to earn it."**
- **"If they don't wee, they don't win."**
- **"Calm is contagious."**
- **"Praise calmly. Let them learn to seek peace, not chaos."**
