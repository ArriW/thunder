# Week 10 Training Schedule

*This week builds seamlessly on the momentum from [Week 9]({{ "/week-9/" | relative_url }}), layering in **grooming desensitization** and extending outings while keeping the crate → potty → play rhythm rock-solid.*

---

## 🎯 Week Overview

- **Age:** 10 weeks old
- **Focus:** Grooming prep, increased carrier duration, adding mild public exposure
- **Nanny Support:** Mon, Tue, Thu & Fri (following the Week 9 flow)
- **Key Additions:** Professional groomer "happy visit" for desensitization, longer carrier rides, slightly richer obedience reps

## 📅 Day-by-Day Highlights

| Day | Key Objectives | Notes |
|-----|----------------|-------|
| **Monday** | • Review last week's skills.<br/>• Add **1-minute brush + treat** after each play block.<br/>• Carrier ride around neighbourhood (10 min). | Aim for calm sniffing instead of whining. |
| **Tuesday** | • **Puppy Training Class #2** – keep criteria low, celebrate small wins.<br/>• Introduce **sit-stay** for 5 seconds. | Take high-value treats & his mat. |
| **Wednesday** | • Work-from-home day again.<br/>• Practice **car starts/stops** while he's in the carrier (engine on/off). | Two 3-min sessions is enough. |
| **Thursday** | • Add **"Down" cue** in low-distraction area.<br/>• Increase brush time to 2 × 30 sec sessions. | Pair every brush stroke with "Yes" → treat. |
| **Friday** | • **Groomer Happy Visit**: enter salon, stand on table, gentle dryer sound at distance while feeding treats.<br/>• Nanny continues standard schedule but includes 3-min leash walk indoors. | Pre-visit: short potty run so he's relaxed. |
| **Weekend** | • Repeat groomer exposure if possible.<br/>• **Car ride to café** patio (stay in carrier, 5–7 min).<br/>• Larger friend meet-up (2 calm vaccinated dogs) in controlled yard. | Monitor stress signs; cut session short if needed. |

## 🛁 Grooming Desensitization Plan

1. **Brush & Treat** – single stroke → treat, build to 10 strokes.
2. **Nail Board** – 3 scratch repetitions → praise.
3. **Blow-Dryer Sounds** – play at low volume during crate nap.
4. **Table Surface** – feed Thunder on raised surface for positive association.

Goal: Thunder is relaxed on table with gentle air noise by week's end.

## 🎓 Training Focus Areas

- **Sit-Stay** 5–7 seconds even with handler step-back.
- **Down** lured then marked immediately.
- **Name + Come** at greater distance (8–10 ft indoors).
- **Loose-Leash Foundations**: "follow" game in hallway (3 reps/visit).

## 🌍 Socialisation Targets

- Meet **5 new people** (delivery person at door counts if treat tossed first).
- Hear **3 novel noises** (skateboard, pan clang, kids shouting) ≤ 10 sec each.
- Ride in carrier **15 min** continuous by Sunday.
