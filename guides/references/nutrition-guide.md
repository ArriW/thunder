# üçΩÔ∏è Pomeranian Puppy Nutrition Guide

Proper nutrition fuels Thunder's growth, training performance, and coat quality. Following **Susan Garrett's philosophy**, we'll use food as a powerful training tool while ensuring optimal development.

## ü•á Susan Garrett's Guiding Principles

1. **75/25 Feeding Split** ‚Äì 75% of daily kibble through training games, 25% in bowl
2. **Quality Over Quantity** ‚Äì Feed premium, small-breed puppy formulas to meet caloric density needs
3. **Controlled Portions** ‚Äì Prevent overfeeding to avoid joint stress and obesity
4. **Food = Training Tool** ‚Äì Make every meal an opportunity for learning
5. **Positive Associations** ‚Äì Meal times should build confidence and engagement

> üéØ **Susan's Philosophy**: "If you feed your dog their breakfast in their bowl, you've just wasted the best part of your day to train your dog."

## üçñ High-Value Training Treats (Susan's Recommendations)

Beyond daily kibble, use these for **jackpot rewards** and **challenging training**:

| Item | Max % of Daily Calories | Susan's Use |
|------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Cooked chicken** | 10% | First successful behaviors, recall training |
| **Cheese cubes** | 5% | Equipment conditioning, grooming desensitization |
| **Freeze-dried liver** | 5% | High-value reward moments |
| **Training treats** | 10% | Public outings, high-distraction training |

> üí° **Susan's Tip**: "Save your highest value treats for the behaviors you need most. Don't waste them on easy stuff."

---

## üíß Hydration with Training Schedule

- **1/2 ‚Äì 1 oz per lb of body weight** per day (approx. 5‚Äì10 oz for 5-10 lb Pom)
- **Fresh water available** except 2 hours before bedtime
- **Post-training hydration** - offer water after active sessions
- **Monitor during training** - panting indicates need for water break

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Foods to Avoid (Toxic)

**Never use these for training rewards:**
- Chocolate, caffeine, xylitol (gum, peanut butter)
- Grapes, raisins
- Onions, garlic, leeks
- Macadamia nuts
- Alcohol & raw dough

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Transitioning Between Foods (Susan's Method)

When changing kibble brands:

| Day | Old Food | New Food | Training Notes |
|-----|----------|----------|----------------|
| 1-2 | 75% | 25% | Monitor training motivation |
| 3-4 | 50% | 50% | Adjust if less food-motivated |
| 5-6 | 25% | 75% | Should maintain training drive |
| 7 | 0% | 100% | Full transition complete |

**Susan's Transition Tips:**
- Keep training portion consistent during transition
- If new food is less motivating, temporarily increase high-value treats
- Monitor stool quality - pause if loose stools occur

---

## üéØ Problem Solving with Food

### Thunder Not Food Motivated?
- **Increase meal intervals** - hungry dogs train better
- **Upgrade reward value** - switch to chicken/cheese
- **Check feeding method** - never free-feed if you want food motivation

### Thunder Too Food Obsessed?
- **Slow the rewards** - don't give constant treats
- **Add impulse control** - "four on floor" before treats
- **Use puzzle toys** - make him work for bowl portion

### Training Progress Slow?
- **Increase reward rate** - be more generous initially
- **Check treat timing** - "Yes!" then treat immediately
- **Verify hunger level** - reduce bowl portion if needed
