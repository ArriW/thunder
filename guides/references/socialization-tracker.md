## People Exposure Types
- Handled Interactions: Person touches, holds, or pets puppy (treat during contact)
- Passive Observations: Puppy observes people without direct interaction (treat for calm)
- Demographic Diversity: Vary age, size, appearance, movement patterns

---

## Dog Exposure Protocol
- Direct Interaction: Brief, friendly greetings with vaccinated dogs (treat, then separate)
- Parallel Walking: Walk 6-10 feet apart, treat for calm
- Distance Observation: Watch dogs from 10+ feet, treat for calm

---

## Safety Protocols
- Pre-vaccination: Only vaccinated dogs in private yards, avoid public grass
- Controlled exposure: Carry puppy in public, use stroller, or visit sanitized classes

---

## Weekly Focus Areas
- Week 8: Home, family, household sounds
- Week 9: Urban intro, market, diverse people

- Choice-based: Puppy approaches, never forced
- Distance management: Start far, move closer
- Frequent breaks, energy matching
