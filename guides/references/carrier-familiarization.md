## 📋 Training Components

### Carrier Familiarization

| **Step**              | **Action**                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Introduce Carrier  | Place it in a familiar area. Leave it open. Toss in high-value treats or meals. |
| 2. Voluntary Entry    | Reward any approach, sniff, or step inside. Feed meals entirely inside carrier. |
| 3. Add Comfort        | Line carrier with soft bedding + familiar toy or chew.                          |
| 4. Close Door Briefly | Once he's comfortable, close door 1–2 sec. Reward. Gradually increase time.     |
| 5. Add Movement       | Lightly lift or move carrier with pup inside. Reward calmness.                  |
| 6. Carrying Practice  | Walk with carrier in hand 1–3 min daily. Reward after.                          |
| 7. Realistic Duration | Build up to 30–60 min inside with minimal fuss, ideally daily.                  |

**Goal:** Thunder sees the carrier as a safe, boring den—not a punishment.

### Simulated Travel Routines

| **Component**           | **Training Activity**                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Car Integration**     | Secure carrier in back seat. Take 5–10 min rides to nowhere with rewards before/after.        |
| **Noise Exposure**      | Play jet engine sounds, airport noise from YouTube at low volume during crate meals.          |
| **Disruption Training** | Brief periods of rolling carrier, hearing carts/suitcases. Gradually increase realism.        |
| **Security Line Drill** | Practice removing pup from carrier, holding calmly, then returning. Use neutral public spots. |
| **Time Simulation**     | Replicate full flight duration: crate in for 60–90 min with background audio and no contact.  |

**Tip:** Practice 2–3x/week. Integrate into regular crate/quiet time once familiarity builds.

### Pre-flight Preparation

| **Checklist Item**          | **Details**                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trazodone Trial**         | 2 dry runs at home or car, spaced 1 week apart. Observe for paradoxical effects. |
| **Carrier Conditioning**    | Ensure pup naps in carrier 30+ min daily, door closed.                           |
| **Vet Health Cert**         | Schedule 7–10 days prior. Most airlines require proof of health for travel.      |
| **Kennel Sizing Confirmed** | Soft-sided, airline-compliant. Pup must fit and turn easily inside.              |
| **Flight Rehearsal Day**    | Simulate full trip (car ride + carrier + waiting) at least once 4–5 days out.    |

### Travel Day Procedures

| **Time**  | **Action**                                                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Morning   | Exercise pup early. Withhold food 2–3 hrs before travel (reduces motion sickness). |
| Departure | Administer trazodone (if prescribed). Pack comfort chew, water, liner, spare pad.  |
| Airport   | Check-in early. Remove pup at security. Comfort + re-crate post-screening.         |
| In Flight | Do not open carrier. Calm presence only. Small chews okay if pup is calm.          |
| Arrival   | Quiet, low-energy exit. Offer potty + water. Let pup decompress in safe area.      |
