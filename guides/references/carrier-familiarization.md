# Carrier Familiarization & Simulated Travel Routines
*Actionable steps to prepare Thunder for air travel and carrier comfort.*

---

## Carrier Familiarization Steps
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Introduce Carrier | Place in familiar area, open. Toss in treats or meals. |
| Voluntary Entry | Reward approach, sniff, or entry. Feed meals inside. |
| Add Comfort | Add bedding and familiar toy/chew. |
| Close Door Briefly | Close door 1–2 sec, reward. Gradually increase time. |
| Add Movement | Lightly lift/move carrier with pup inside. Reward calmness. |
| Carrying Practice | Walk with carrier 1–3 min daily. Reward after. |
| Realistic Duration | Build up to 30–60 min inside daily. |

**Goal:** Carrier = safe, boring den.

---

## Simulated Travel Routines
| Component | Training Activity |
|-----------|------------------|
| Car Integration | Secure carrier in car. 5–10 min rides, reward before/after. |
| Noise Exposure | Play jet/airport sounds at low volume during crate meals. |
| Disruption Training | Roll carrier, expose to carts/suitcases. Increase realism. |
| Security Line Drill | Practice removing/returning pup to carrier in public spots. |
| Time Simulation | Replicate flight: 60–90 min in carrier with background audio, no contact. |

**Tip:** Practice 2–3x/week. Integrate into crate/quiet time.

## Pre-flight Preparation Checklist
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Trazodone Trial | 2 dry runs at home/car, 1 week apart. Observe effects. |
| Carrier Conditioning | Ensure daily 30+ min naps in carrier, door closed. |
| Vet Health Cert | Schedule 7–10 days prior. Required by airlines. |
| Kennel Sizing | Soft-sided, airline-compliant. Pup must fit/turn easily. |
| Flight Rehearsal | Simulate full trip (car + carrier + waiting) 4–5 days out. |

---

## Travel Day Procedures
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| Morning | Exercise early. Withhold food 2–3 hrs before travel. |
| Departure | Administer trazodone (if prescribed). Pack chew, water, liner, spare pad. |
| Airport | Check-in early. Remove pup at security. Comfort, re-crate post-screening. |
| In Flight | Do not open carrier. Calm presence only. Small chews if calm. |
| Arrival | Quiet exit. Potty + water. Decompress in safe area. |
