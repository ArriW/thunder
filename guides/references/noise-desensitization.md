# Noise Desensitization Guide
*Systematic approach to building Thunder's tolerance for travel sounds and movement.*

---

## Sound Desensitization Steps
| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| Intro | Play soft ambient audio (doorbells, traffic, kitchen sounds, children, barking) during meals/play. |
| Build | Gradually increase sound volume across sessions; reward with calm engagement or food toys. |
| Realism | Stack sounds (e.g. city ambience + dogs + vacuum); introduce via daily background play. |
| Generalization | Play sound files in multiple environments (crate, playpen, kitchen, porch) to build neutrality. |

**Goal:** Thunder remains calm and engaged during normal activities regardless of environmental sounds.
