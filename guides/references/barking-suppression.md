# 🧭 Pomeranian Barking Suppression Guide

**Objective:** Reduce and manage barking across all contexts through proactive routines, conditioned quiet cues, and appropriate redirection.

*This guide is designed specifically for Thunder and can be implemented starting from 8 weeks old.*

## 🔄 PART 1: Universal Response to Barking

**When your Pomeranian barks, follow this consistent protocol to avoid reinforcing it:**

| **Step**                                            | **Action**                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🛑 **Step 1: Freeze**                               | Do **not** talk, touch, or look at your dog. Remove attention entirely.                                |
| 👂 **Step 2: Assess Trigger**                       | Identify what caused the barking (door, sound, person, etc.). No response until barking stops.         |
| 🤫 **Step 3: Wait for Silence**                     | The instant your dog stops barking (even briefly), **mark** it ("yes" or click) and **reward calmly**. |
| 📉 **Step 4: Reduce Trigger Intensity (if needed)** | If overstimulated, increase distance or obscure visual/sound (e.g. close blinds, move behind door).    |
| 🎯 **Step 5: Redirect**                             | Ask for an incompatible behavior ("place," "touch," "watch me") and reward compliance.                 |

## ✅ PART 2: Proactive Daily Anti-Barking Behaviors

Engage in these habits **daily** to reduce reactivity baseline:

| **Behavior**                    | **Description**                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desensitize to sounds**       | Play doorbells, knocks, dogs barking, etc. at low volume during meals/treats. |
| **Visual trigger control**      | Use frosted window film or baby gates to reduce overstimulation.              |
| **Daily mat training**          | Condition "settle" on a bed/mat with chew or treat. Use for guests/TV/doors.  |
| **Engagement work**             | 5–10 minutes of "sit," "touch," "look," etc. daily to build stimulus control. |
| **Tug or fetch sessions**       | Burns energy, reduces arousal spikes that lead to frustration barking.        |
| **Chew rotation**               | Rotate frozen Kongs, bully sticks, or Yak chews for quiet focus time.         |
| **Controlled novelty exposure** | Visit parks, walk near skateboards, bikes, etc. with food pairings.           |

## 🚪 Trigger-Specific Proactive Protocols

| **Trigger**          | **Proactive Behavior**                                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Door knock**       | Teach "place" cue (go to mat) before knocking sound. Practice daily with paired treats. |
| **TV barking**       | Use "look at that" game with TV animals; reward calm glances, escalate volume slowly.   |
| **Outside sounds**   | Mask with white noise machine. Reward for calm behavior near windows.                   |
| **You coming home**  | Avoid exciting greetings. Ignore until dog is calm. Then greet quietly on mat.          |
| **Barking at you**   | Do not respond to barking for attention. Reward quiet moments with engagement.          |
| **Other dog**        | Use parallel play. Interrupt barky outbursts with calm leash guidance, not scolding.    |
| **Park stimulation** | Practice "sit-look" games on approach. Only allow access when calm behavior shown.      |

## 🧠 Conditioning the "Quiet" Cue

| **Step**          | **What to Do**                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Catch silence  | When barking stops, say "quiet," mark with "yes," and treat. |
| 2. Add cue        | After ~30 successful catches, say "quiet" *during* barking. |
| 3. Increase delay | Build up from 1 sec silence → 3 → 5 → 10 sec before reward.  |
| 4. Practice daily | Integrate into all trigger environments gradually.           |

## 🚫 What *Not* to Do

* ❌ Never yell or bark back (sounds like joining in).
* ❌ Avoid using punishment-based collars or spray bottles.
* ❌ Don't reinforce barking with accidental attention (even eye contact).
* ❌ Don't laugh or feed during barky excitement (can accidentally condition it).

## 📘 Optional Enhancements

| **Tool**               | **Use**                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| White noise machine    | Masks hallway/urban noise during crate time.              |
| Remote treat dispenser | Can reward quiet crate behavior while you're out.         |
| Clicker                | Provides precise timing for quiet/silence reward marking. |

## 🗓️ Integration with Weekly Training

### Week 8-10 (Early Implementation)
- Focus on establishing the universal response protocol
- Begin basic sound desensitization during meal times
- Start "quiet" cue conditioning with natural silence moments

### Week 11-16 (Building Foundation)

- Increase complexity of sound desensitization

### Week 17-24 (Advanced Training)
- Refine "quiet" cue in various environments
- Practice proactive protocols in real-world situations
- Integrate with advanced obedience training
