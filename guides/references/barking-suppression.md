# Barking Suppression Guide
*Actionable steps to reduce and manage barking in all contexts.*

---

## Universal Response Protocol
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Freeze | Do not talk, touch, or look at your dog. Remove attention entirely. |
| Assess Trigger | Identify what caused the barking. No response until barking stops. |
| Wait for Silence | The instant your dog stops barking (even briefly), mark it ("Good!" or click) and reward calmly. |
| Reduce Trigger Intensity | If overstimulated, increase distance or obscure visual/sound. |
| Redirect | Ask for an incompatible behavior ("place," "touch," "focus") and reward compliance. |

## Daily Anti-Barking Habits
| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Sound desensitization | Play doorbells, knocks, dogs barking, etc. at low volume during meals/treats. |
| Visual trigger control | Use frosted window film or baby gates to reduce overstimulation. |
| Daily mat training | Condition "settle" on a bed/mat with chew or treat. Use for guests/TV/doors. |
| Engagement work | 5–10 minutes of "sit," "touch," "focus," etc. daily to build stimulus control. |
| Tug or fetch | Burns energy, reduces arousal spikes. |
| Chew rotation | Rotate frozen Kongs, bully sticks, or Yak chews for quiet focus time. |
| Controlled novelty | Visit parks, walk near skateboards, bikes, etc. with food pairings. |

## Trigger-Specific Protocols
| Trigger | Proactive Behavior |
|---------|-------------------|
| Door knock | Teach "place" cue before knocking sound. Practice daily with paired treats. |
| TV barking | Use "look at that" game with TV animals; reward calm glances, escalate volume slowly. |
| Outside sounds | Mask with white noise machine. Reward for calm behavior near windows. |
| You coming home | Avoid exciting greetings. Ignore until dog is calm. Then greet quietly on mat. |
| Barking at you | Do not respond to barking for attention. Reward quiet moments with engagement. |
| Other dog | Use parallel play. Interrupt barky outbursts with calm leash guidance, not scolding. |
| Park stimulation | Practice "sit-focus" games on approach. Only allow access when calm behavior shown. |

## Conditioning the "Quiet" Cue
1. Catch silence: When barking stops, say "quiet," mark with "Good!", and treat.
2. Add cue: After ~30 successful catches, say "quiet" during barking.
3. Increase delay: Build up from 1 sec silence → 3 → 5 → 10 sec before reward.
4. Practice daily: Integrate into all trigger environments gradually.

## What Not to Do
- Never yell or bark back.
- Avoid punishment-based collars or spray bottles.
- Don't reinforce barking with accidental attention (even eye contact).
- Don't reward barky excitement with food or play.
