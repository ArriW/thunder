# 🛁 Pomeranian Grooming Reference Guide

Keeping Thunder's signature double-coat healthy is about *prevention* and *positive associations*. Use this page as a lookup table whenever you or a nanny needs to handle brushing, baths, or nail care.

## ✂️ Core Grooming Objectives

1. Maintain skin & coat health (shed control, prevent mats)
2. Condition the puppy to **enjoy** handling (no restraint battles)
3. Prevent overgrowth-related issues (long nails, ear debris, tear stains)
4. Build skills for professional grooming visits and vet exams

## 🗓️ Grooming Frequency at a Glance

| Task | 8-12 wks | 13-24 wks | Adult |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Brushing | 3× / week | 4× / week | 2-3× / week |
| Nail Trim | Weekly | Every 7-10 days | Every 2 weeks |

## 🧰 Recommended Tools

- Slicker brush (soft pins)
- Metal greyhound comb
- Nail grinder (silent model) **or** small-breed guillotine clippers
- Styptic powder (Kwik-Stop)
- Canine-safe ear cleaner + cotton pads
- Whitening/brightening shampoo for white areas
- Lick mat + peanut-butter smears (to occupy during baths)

## 🔄 Conditioning Protocol (Marker-Based)

1. **Introduce tool visually** → mark ("yes") → treat.
2. **Touch tool to body part** (1-sec contact) → mark → treat.
3. **Perform 1-2 actual strokes/filings** → mark → treat.
4. **Gradually chain** strokes until full grooming task achieved **without stress signals** (lip lick, avoidance, yelp).

Repeat in micro-sessions (<3 min) daily for the first 2 weeks.

## 🧽 Detailed Steps

### Brushing & De-Shedding
1. Start with **slicker brush**: work *with* coat lay from neck → tail.
2. Follow with **comb**: ensures no hidden mats (comb should glide).
3. Praise & treat for calm stillness every 5-10 strokes.
4. If mat found → hold base of fur, use small strokes with slicker to tease out. Never yank.

### Nail Maintenance
1. Pair grinder sound with treats *(classical conditioning)*.
2. Trim **one nail only** first session → jackpot reward.
3. Keep sessions under 1-minute; build to full paw.
4. Stop before puppy squirms to cement a "that was easy" memory.

### Bath Time
1. Place lick-mat on tub wall; smear wet food.
2. Lukewarm water only. Pre-dilute shampoo (1:3) for easy rinse.
3. Avoid face/ears with direct spray; use damp cloth instead.
4. Towel-blot, then **cool-setting** blow-dry while brushing.

### Ear & Eye Care
- Use cotton pad, not swab inside canal.
- Wipe ears until pad shows faint discoloration only.
- For tear stains: saline-soaked pad, wipe downward away from eye.

## 🚩 Red Flags — Call Groomer/Vet

- Mats tight to skin you cannot separate
- Yelping or aggression during handling despite conditioning
- Ear odor, redness, or discharge
- Nails bleeding frequently despite quick avoidance
