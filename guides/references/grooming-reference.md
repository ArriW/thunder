- Praise/treat every 5-10 strokes
- For mats: hold base, tease out gently

### Nail Maintenance
- Pair grinder sound with treats
- Trim one nail first session, jackpot reward
- Keep sessions under 1 min, build to full paw
- Stop before puppy squirms

### Bath
- Lick-mat on tub wall
- Lukewarm water, pre-dilute shampoo
- Avoid face/ears with spray; use damp cloth
- Towel-blot, cool blow-dry while brushing

### Ear/Eye Care
- Cotton pad, not swab, for ears
- Wipe until pad faintly discolored
- For tear stains: saline pad, wipe downward

## Red Flags (Call Groomer/Vet)
