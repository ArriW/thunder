# 🚽 Potty (Toilet) Training Guide

Drawing from Steve Mann's *Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy* (Chapter 4, pp. 51-70) and our own daily rhythm, this reference lays out a clear, humane path to 85-100 % outdoor success.

---
## 🎯 Goals

1. Puppy toilets **outside/on-pad** on cue 85 %+ of the time by 12 weeks.  
2. Night accidents reduced to **zero** by 14 weeks.  
3. Puppy **signals** need to go (body language, bell, or target) by 16 weeks.

## 🛠️ Supplies Checklist

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Designated potty zone (grass pad, real grass, or specific yard spot) | Consistency builds habit |
| High-value treats in a sealed pouch | Immediate reinforcement |
| **Watcher** (human supervisor) | Observes pre-potty signals (see below) |
| Lightweight leash | Guides pup straight to zone, prevents play detours |
| Enzyme cleaner | Removes indoor scent to avoid repeat mistakes |

> **PDF Reference:** See pp. 38, 51-59 for "Watcher" role and accelerated toileting.

## ⏰ When To Take Puppy Out

1. **Immediately after** waking up (crate naps & overnight).  
2. **Right after** meals & big drinks.  
3. **After** 5-10 min of play/training.  
4. **Every** 60-90 min of awake time even without signals.

💡 **Rule of Thumb:** Age in months + 1 = max hours between potty breaks (up to 4 h).

## 🐾 6-Step Outdoor Potty Routine

1. Clip leash & head **straight to potty zone** (no detours).  
2. Stand still; give your potty cue (e.g., "Go potty").  
3. **Wait silently** up to 3 min.  
4. If pup toilets: **mark & reward** *the moment they finish* with praise + treat.  
5. Release for 2-3 min play/sniff bonus.  
6. If no potty: return to crate/den for 10-15 min, then try again.

> 📖 *Easy Peasy* mantra: **"No wee, no play."** (p. 52)

## 🏃 Accelerated Toileting (Advanced Hack)

When time-pressed (bad weather, apartment living):  
• Bring puppy on leash to potty spot with **higher-value treats**.  
• Reduce the **wait window to 60 sec**.  
• On success, jackpot reward & indoor freedom.  
• On failure, back to crate & retry.  

Used sparingly, this sharpens the cue/response (see p. 38).

---
## 🌙 Overnight Strategy

1. Last outing at **bedtime (~11 pm)**.  
2. Set alarm for **middle-of-night break** (age in weeks ÷ 2 ≈ hours).  
3. Lights low, no chatter—business only.  
4. Gradually stretch time by **15 min every 2 nights** if pup stays dry.

## 👀 Spotting Signals (Watcher's Job)

Common pre-potty cues (pp. 64-66):

- Circling/sniffing floor
- Sudden stop in play
- Whining at gate/door
- Heading to previous accident area

Have leash & treats ready; beat the clock!

---
## 🧹 Handling Mistakes

1. Interrupt with calm **"Uh-oh"**, scoop pup to potty zone.  
2. If finishes outside, **reward**; if not, clean silently.  
3. Sanitize with enzyme cleaner; remove access to that spot for 24 h.

Never punish—fear delays learning and harms your bond.
