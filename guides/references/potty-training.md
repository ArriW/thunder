## Supplies Checklist

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Designated potty zone | Consistency builds habit |
| High-value treats | Immediate reinforcement |
| Watcher (human) | Observes pre-potty signals |
| Lightweight leash | Guides pup to zone |

## When To Take Puppy Out
- After waking up
- After meals & big drinks
- After 5–10 min play/training
- Every 60–90 min awake
- Rule: Age in months + 1 = max hours between breaks (up to 4h)

---

## 6-Step Outdoor Potty Routine
1. Leash, straight to potty zone
2. Stand still, give cue ("Go potty")
3. Wait silently up to 3 min
4. If toilets: mark & reward after finish
5. Release for 2–3 min play/sniff
6. If not: return to crate/den, retry in 10–15 min

---

## Accelerated Toileting (Advanced)
- Use higher-value treats, reduce wait to 60 sec
- On success: jackpot reward, indoor freedom
- On failure: back to crate, retry

---

## Overnight Strategy
- Last outing at bedtime
- Set alarm for middle-of-night break (age in weeks ÷ 2 ≈ hours)
- Lights low, no chatter
- Stretch time by 15 min every 2 nights if dry

---

## Spotting Signals
- Circling/sniffing
- Sudden stop in play
- Whining at gate/door
- Heading to previous accident area

---

## Handling Mistakes
1. Calm "Uh-oh", scoop to potty zone
2. If finishes outside, reward; if not, clean silently
3. Sanitize with enzyme cleaner, remove access for 24h
