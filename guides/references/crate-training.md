# Crate Training Guide
*Step-by-step process to make the crate your puppy's favourite place and a foundation for training and travel.*

---

## Crate Training Objectives
- Crate = positive, rewarding place
- Voluntary entry and calm settling
- Foundation for travel and problem prevention

---

## Crate Introduction Steps

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Open-Door Buffet | Scatter treats inside, let puppy choose to enter/exit. No door closing. Reward every entry. |
| 2. Hand-Delivered Rewards | Toss treat to back, reward through bars. Add "crate" cue. Practice 8–10 reps. |
| 3. Duration with Food | Feed part of meal in crate, close door 10–30 sec. Open before whining. Reward calm exits. |
| 4. Door-Closed Breaks | Gradually increase closed-door time. Sit nearby. Random treats for calm. Reward quiet. |
| 5. Out-of-Sight Practice | Leave room with door closed. Add background noise. Return unpredictably with treats. Build to 45–60 min. |

## Overnight Routine
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Cue "crate," reward entry |
| 2 | Place frozen KONG inside |
| 3 | Calm "goodnight"; crate beside bed |
| 4 | Night potty: no excitement, straight back to crate |
| 5 | Morning: treat before opening crate, build positive morning association |

---

## Problem Prevention
- Never use crate for punishment or time-outs
- Practice departures/arrivals without leaving
- Leave crate open for voluntary naps
- Randomly cue "crate" and reward choice

---

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Whining | Return to Stage 1, increase reward rate |
| Refuses to enter | Play "Training is Fun" game, use higher-value treats |
| Soils inside | Shorten intervals, check feeding schedule |
| Chews bedding | Remove soft items, provide frozen KONG |
| Barks alone | Build duration more gradually, practice fake departures |

## Advanced Crate Games
- Build "crate" cue: point, reward for look/step/entry
- Distinguish "place" (mat) vs. "crate" (enclosed)
- Practice with travel carrier and in different locations

---

## Daily Integration
- Morning: crate cue + breakfast
- Midday: crate nap with KONG
- Evening: crate game + bedtime
- Pair crate with collar/travel carrier/sound desensitization
