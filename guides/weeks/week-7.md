# 🏡 Week 7: Homecoming Weekend
**Friday, July 11 – Sunday, July 13, 2025**  
*Thunder arrives at 7 weeks old*

> "My puppy is doing **the best he can** with the very limited education he has **in the environment I've put him in."

This critical 72-hour period sets the foundation for Thunder's entire life. We'll be **intentional** about every experience, using classical conditioning to create positive associations while preventing bad habits from forming.

### 🎲 First Carrier Adventure (10:30-11:30 AM)

**Pre-Adventure Setup (10:00-10:30 AM):**
- Apply classical conditioning principles from the [Crate Training Guide](/crate-training/) to the carrier as a mini-crate.
1. **Carrier conditioning games** (5 min):
   - Show carrier → "Good!" → treat
   - Put treats inside → Thunder enters → more treats
   - Practice in/out 3-4 times with rewards
2. **Load carrier essentials**: High-value treats, small water dish, comfort item
3. **Your prep**: Treats in pocket, route planned, backup plan ready

**Neighborhood Walk Protocol (10:30-11:00 AM):**
1. **Start close to home** - just to end of block initially

   - **Friend's front yard** (known dogs vaccinated)
   - **Concrete sidewalk area** (center, away from corners)
   - **Your own front steps/porch**
4. **Treat delivery**: Person appears → treat, sound occurs → treat
5. **Back to carrier**: "Crate" cue → Thunder enters → treat

**Safe Zone Selection Criteria:**
- ✅ **Private property** with permission
- ✅ **Clean concrete/brick surfaces**
- ✅ **Low foot traffic** areas
- ✅ **Easy retreat** to carrier
- ❌ **Public grass** or dog-frequented areas
