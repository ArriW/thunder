# üè° Week 7: Homecoming Weekend
**Friday, July 11 ‚Äì Sunday, July 13, 2025**  
*Thunder arrives at 7 weeks old*

> "My puppy is doing **the best he can** with the very limited education he has **in the environment I've put him in."

This critical 72-hour period sets the foundation for Thunder's entire life. We'll be **intentional** about every experience, using classical conditioning to create positive associations while preventing bad habits from forming.
