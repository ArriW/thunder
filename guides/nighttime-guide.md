# THUNDER'S WEEK 1 NIGHTTIME POTTY HABIT - PDF GUIDE

## Objective:
Establish a reliable overnight potty schedule for an 8-week-old Pomeranian (Thunder) to avoid crate accidents.

---

## WEEK 1 OVERNIGHT SCHEDULE:
- **Final Potty:** 10–11 PM (just before bed)  
- **Scheduled Potty Break:** 1:30–2:00 AM (wake up and take out even if asleep)  
- **Morning Potty:** 6:00–7:00 AM

---

## KEY RULES:
- Wake Thunder at 2 AM **regardless** of whining or sleep  
- Carry him **directly** to the potty zone (no play, no talk)  
- Allow **3–5 minutes** to pee, then return to crate  
- **Do NOT feed or praise** — this is a relief trip, not training  
- If he doesn't pee, still return him to the crate  
- **Ignore** post-return whining unless it's urgent or escalating

---

## WHEN TO STOP NIGHT POTTY:
You may skip the 2 AM break when **all** conditions are met:
- **3–5 consecutive dry nights**
- **No night whining**
- **He is at least 11–12 weeks old**

---

## GOAL:
Full overnight sleep by **12–16 weeks** without accidents or attention-seeking behaviors.
