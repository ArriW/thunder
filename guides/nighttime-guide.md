## ðŸš« Critical Rules

### **Never Skip Scheduled Breaks**
- Wake puppy at designated times regardless of whining
- Whining is NOT a reliable indicator of need
- Scheduled breaks prevent accidents and attention-seeking

### **Maintain Neutral Energy**
- No excited greetings or praise during night breaks
- Keep interactions business-like and boring
- Save enthusiasm for morning success

### **Ignore Non-Urgent Whining**
- Distinguish between potty needs and attention-seeking
- Scheduled breaks eliminate guesswork
- Responding to whining teaches demanding behavior

### **Consistent Potty Location**
- Same spot every time, day and night
- Clear path from crate to potty area
- Weather-appropriate but location-consistent

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Problem: Puppy Won't Pee During Scheduled Break**
**Solution:**
- Wait full 5 minutes before giving up
- Try different potty commands ("go potty," "get busy")
- Still return to crate - don't extend break time
- Maintain schedule - bladder will adjust

### **Problem: Accidents in Crate Despite Schedule**
**Solutions:**
- Move schedule 30 minutes earlier
- Check for medical issues (UTI, parasites)
- Ensure crate is proper size (too large encourages accidents)
- Review evening water intake timing

### **Problem: Excessive Whining After Potty Break**
**Solutions:**
- Ensure break was truly business-like
- Cover crate to reduce stimulation
- Check for comfort issues (too hot/cold)
- Maintain consistent ignore policy

### **Problem: Early Morning Wake-Up Calls**
**Solutions:**
- Gradually move morning time later by 15-minute increments
- Ensure adequate evening exercise
- Check if room is too bright at sunrise
- Maintain consistent response - don't reward early demands
