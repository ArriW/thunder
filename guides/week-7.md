# 🏡 Week 7: Homecoming Weekend
**Friday, July 11 – Sunday, July 13, 2025**  
*Thunder arrives at 7 weeks old*

> "My puppy is doing **the best he can** with the very limited education he has **in the environment I've put him in." – Susan Garrett

This critical 72-hour period sets the foundation for Thunder's entire life. Following Susan Garrett's philosophy, we'll be **intentional** about every experience, using classical conditioning to create positive associations while preventing bad habits from forming.

## 🎯 Day 3: Sunday, July 13 – Susan's 5 Games Mastery

### Goals
- 90% potty accuracy with "potty" cue
- Thunder = **meaningless** → **good** (name recognition)
- Happy crate entry (crate = good things)
- 3-hour overnight sleep stretch

### Susan's 5 Games Integration
**Morning Session (30 minutes total):**
1. **Game 1 - Training is Fun** (10 min): High-rate treat delivery, throw cookies in crate
2. **Game 2 - Name Recognition** (5 min): "Thunder" → cookie toss → return for second cookie
3. **Game 3 - This Place** (10 min): Mat/bed targeting with rewards
4. **Game 4 - Break Word** (3 min): "Break" → "cookie" → permission to move
5. **Game 5 - Four on Floor** (2 min): Wait for rewards, no jumping

### Leash Conditioning (Susan's Method)
1. **Leash in bowl** → treats → targeting
2. **Leash alone** → nose touch → "Yes!" → treat
3. **Leash clip approach** → "Yes!" → treat → **remove leash** → play continues
4. **Repeat 3-5 times** so leash ≠ terminal ending

### Special Activities
- **Morning**: "Puppy push-ups" (sit-down-sit) with 75% meal portion

- **Evening**: Measure & photo for Week 8 tracking
