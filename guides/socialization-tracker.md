# üêæ Socialization Tracker ‚Äì 100 People & 25 Dogs

Early, positive introductions to *novel people* and *friendly dogs* build the calm confidence Thunder needs for a travel-ready life. Use this page to plan, track, and adjust progress week-by-week.

> üìä **Goal:** 100 individual people and 25 dog exposures by the end of Week 12 (age ~12 weeks).

## üõ†Ô∏è Weekly Exposure Implementation

### **High-Value Encounter Protocols**

**People Encounters:**
1. **Treat Toss First** ‚Äì Person tosses treat before reaching toward Thunder
2. **Carrier Home-Base** ‚Äì Safe retreat option in busy areas

## üè° Home-Base Strategy (Steve Mann-Inspired)

*‚ÄúConfidence grows when a puppy knows he can bail out at any time.‚Äù* ‚Äì *Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy*, Ch. 8

- **Set Up First, Explore Second** ‚Äì Drop the carrier/pen, load with a chew, *then* let Thunder survey the scene.
- **Distance = Success** ‚Äì Start far enough away that he'll *choose* to step out; close distance only if his body stays loose.
- **Short Re-Fuel Stops** ‚Äì After 2‚Äì3 greetings or 5 min of novelty, cue "carrier" and pay him for hopping back in.
- **Surface Hygiene** ‚Äì In high-traffic areas (pet store car park, caf√© patio) line the pen with a washable mat to limit pathogen exposure until vaccines complete.

## üéØ Combined Novelty Challenges

Incorporate multiple stimuli at once (Mann's "layering" concept) to accelerate confidence:

| Week | Mini-Challenge Example |
|------|-----------------------|
| 8 | Friend wearing a **hat** & **rustling shopping bag** while Thunder stands on a **welcome mat** |
| 9 | Meet a **bearded man** while a **skateboard rolls past** at 20 ft |
| 10 | Groomer staff member in **apron** offers treats on the **elevated table** |
| 11 | Child with **bike helmet** pets Thunder while **bus doors hiss** 30 ft away |
| 12 | Wheelchair user offers treat as **pigeon flock scatters** nearby |

## üîó Integration with Weekly Training Schedules

### **Week-by-Week Socialization Focus**

- **Valencia Street**: Skateboard/bike desensitization, storefront variety

### **Pre-Vaccination Surface Safety Map**

| Location Type | Week 8 | Week 9 | Week 10 | Week 11+ |
|---------------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Home/Private Yards** | ‚úÖ Full access | ‚úÖ Full access | ‚úÖ Full access | ‚úÖ Full access |

| **Parks** | ‚ùå Avoid | ‚úÖ Carried only | ‚úÖ Periphery only | ‚úÖ Controlled access |

> üí° **High-Value Treat Strategy:** Use chopped chicken, cheese, and freeze-dried liver in a side pouch. Replenish at each new environment to maintain reward value throughout long socialization sessions. 

## üå≥ Controlled Environments & Calm Walks

Start new experiences in the **safest, most predictable space‚Äîyour home**‚Äîthen layer in new locations gradually:

1. **Living-Room Rehearsal** ‚Äì Practice name game, settle mat, and loose-leash skills with zero distractions.
2. **Garden / Quiet Courtyard** ‚Äì Add mild sights & smells.
3. **Residential Sidewalk** ‚Äì Short, relaxed walks; reward noticing people, cars, scooters at distance.
4. **Busier High Street** ‚Äì After Week 10, visit briefly, staying on the outer edge; retreat to carrier when crowds swell.

*Rule of thumb: if Thunder stops eating, you've gone too far‚Äîadd distance or end the session.*

## üé≤ Object & Surface Desensitization Games

Rotate a "novelty basket" 3√ó/week:
- **Textures:** bubble-wrap, rubber mat, crinkly tarp
- **Household items:** umbrella open/close, rolling suitcase, vacuum (off at first)
- **Sounds:** YouTube city noises at low volume, metal spoon drop, skateboard roll

Mark and reward **investigation at his own pace**‚Äîno luring onto scary items.

## üçº Early Socialization Before Full Vaccines

Use a **stroller, sling, or carrier** so Thunder can watch the world without paws on pathogen-rich ground. Reward curiosity; end outing the moment he shows stress yawns or tucks tail.

## üêï‚Äçü¶∫ Dog-to-Dog Introduction Ladder

1. **Sight at Distance** ‚Äì 30 ft; feed Thunder for looking, then looking back to you.
2. **Parallel Walk** ‚Äì ‚â• 10 ft apart, walking same direction.
3. **Cross-Over Arc** ‚Äì Gentle curve passing; break away after a glance.
4. **Sniff & Split** ‚Äì 2-3 sec butt sniff, handler calls away, jackpot treat.
5. **Short Off-Lead Play** ‚Äì Secure yard with calm dog; interrupt every 30 sec for treat scatter & reset.

Advance only if BOTH dogs stay loose-bodied and responsive.
