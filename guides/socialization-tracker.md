# 🐾 Socialization Tracker – 100 People & 25 Dogs

Early, positive introductions to *novel people* and *friendly dogs* build the calm confidence Thunder needs for a travel-ready life. Use this page to plan, track, and adjust progress week-by-week.

> 📊 **Goal:** 100 individual people and 25 dog exposures by the end of Week 12 (age ~12 weeks).

## 📅 Weekly Exposure Plan

| Week | Age (wks) | New People Target | New Dog Target | Cumulative People | Cumulative Dogs |
|------|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 8 | 8 | **10** | **1** | 10 | 1 |
| 9 | 9 | **15** | **3** | 25 | 4 |
| 10 | 10 | **20** | **5** | 45 | 9 |
| 11 | 11 | **25** | **6** | 70 | 15 |
| 12 | 12 | **30** | **10** | 100 | 25 |

*Feel free to shift numbers between weeks to suit Thunder's energy, vaccine schedule, and weather—just keep the cumulative totals on track.*

## 🛠️ How to Make Every Exposure Count

### People Encounters
1. **Treat Toss First** – Ask the person to toss a treat **before** reaching toward Thunder.
2. **Carrier / Mobile Pen Home-Base** – In busy or germ-heavy areas, park his **carrier, crate, or folding pen** as a safe observation perch so he can choose engagement or retreat.
3. **Vary Demographics** – Seek diversity: hats, sunglasses, wheelchairs, children, beards, delivery uniforms.
4. **Short & Sweet** – 3–5 sec greet → reward → move away. End sessions before fatigue.
5. **Calm Guest Protocol** – Invite people to sit, ignore Thunder, and drop treats; reward voluntary approach rather than forced pats.

### Dog Encounters
1. **Vaccinated & Calm** – Only fully vaccinated, friendly dogs until Thunder's shots are complete.
2. **Parallel Walks First** – 5–10 ft apart, then gradually close distance if both remain loose-bodied.
3. **One-on-One** – Avoid overwhelming group settings; quality beats quantity.
4. **Manage Size Differences** – Start with similar-size or calm larger dogs lying down.
5. **Sniff & Split** – Allow brief behind-to-head sniffing, then call pups apart for a treat before arousal spikes.
6. **Mentor Dog Advantage** – Schedule play dates with an older, well-socialized dog that models calm greetings.

## 🏡 Home-Base Strategy (Steve Mann-Inspired)

*“Confidence grows when a puppy knows he can bail out at any time.”* – *Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy*, Ch. 8

- **Set Up First, Explore Second** – Drop the carrier/pen, load with a chew, *then* let Thunder survey the scene.
- **Distance = Success** – Start far enough away that he'll *choose* to step out; close distance only if his body stays loose.
- **Short Re-Fuel Stops** – After 2–3 greetings or 5 min of novelty, cue "carrier" and pay him for hopping back in.
- **Surface Hygiene** – In high-traffic areas (pet store car park, café patio) line the pen with a washable mat to limit pathogen exposure until vaccines complete.

## 🎯 Combined Novelty Challenges

Incorporate multiple stimuli at once (Mann's "layering" concept) to accelerate confidence:

| Week | Mini-Challenge Example |
|------|-----------------------|
| 8 | Friend wearing a **hat** & **rustling shopping bag** while Thunder stands on a **welcome mat** |
| 9 | Meet a **bearded man** while a **skateboard rolls past** at 20 ft |
| 10 | Groomer staff member in **apron** offers treats on the **elevated table** |
| 11 | Child with **bike helmet** pets Thunder while **bus doors hiss** 30 ft away |
| 12 | Wheelchair user offers treat as **pigeon flock scatters** nearby |

## 🔗 Quick Access Per Week
- **[Week 8 Schedule]({{ "/puppy-schedule/" | relative_url }})** – Home-coming foundation
- **[Week 9 Schedule]({{ "/week-9/" | relative_url }})** – First puppy class & vet social visit
- **[Week 10 Schedule]({{ "/week-10/" | relative_url }})** – Groomer "happy visit" week
- **[Week 11-12 Schedule]({{ "/week-11-12/" | relative_url }})** – Outdoor adventures ramp up

> 💡 **Tip:** Use a high-value treat bank (chopped chicken, cheese) in a side pouch; replenish at each new environment to keep encounters rewarding. 

## 🌳 Controlled Environments & Calm Walks

Start new experiences in the **safest, most predictable space—your home**—then layer in new locations gradually:

1. **Living-Room Rehearsal** – Practice name game, settle mat, and loose-leash skills with zero distractions.
2. **Garden / Quiet Courtyard** – Add mild sights & smells.
3. **Residential Sidewalk** – Short, relaxed walks; reward noticing people, cars, scooters at distance.
4. **Busier High Street** – After Week 10, visit briefly, staying on the outer edge; retreat to carrier when crowds swell.

*Rule of thumb: if Thunder stops eating, you've gone too far—add distance or end the session.*

## 🎲 Object & Surface Desensitization Games

Rotate a "novelty basket" 3×/week:
- **Textures:** bubble-wrap, rubber mat, crinkly tarp
- **Household items:** umbrella open/close, rolling suitcase, vacuum (off at first)
- **Sounds:** YouTube city noises at low volume, metal spoon drop, skateboard roll

Mark and reward **investigation at his own pace**—no luring onto scary items.

## 🍼 Early Socialization Before Full Vaccines

Use a **stroller, sling, or carrier** so Thunder can watch the world without paws on pathogen-rich ground. Reward curiosity; end outing the moment he shows stress yawns or tucks tail.

## 🐕‍🦺 Dog-to-Dog Introduction Ladder

1. **Sight at Distance** – 30 ft; feed Thunder for looking, then looking back to you.
2. **Parallel Walk** – ≥ 10 ft apart, walking same direction.
3. **Cross-Over Arc** – Gentle curve passing; break away after a glance.
4. **Sniff & Split** – 2-3 sec butt sniff, handler calls away, jackpot treat.
5. **Short Off-Lead Play** – Secure yard with calm dog; interrupt every 30 sec for treat scatter & reset.

Advance only if BOTH dogs stay loose-bodied and responsive.
