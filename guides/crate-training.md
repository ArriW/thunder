# 🏠 Crate (Den) Training Guide

A well-introduced crate becomes your puppy's **safe, calm home base**—not a punishment box. This guide compiles best practices from Steve Mann's *Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy* (pp. 34-40 & 51-59) with our own travel-readiness goals.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Build a **positive association** with the crate (food, chews, calm).
2. Teach your puppy to **enter, relax, and remain** until released.
3. Use the crate as the backbone of the **crate → potty → play → crate** daily rhythm.
4. Prepare for **carriers & hotel stays** by adding motion and novel environments later.

## 📦 Supplies

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Sturdy crate (wire or hard-sided) + cover | Creates den-like feel |
| Soft vet-bed or towel | Comfort & scent retention |
| **High-value treats** | Immediate positive reinforcement |
| Stuffed/Frozen KONG | Sustained calm chewing inside the crate |
| Lightweight leash | Guiding pup in/out without chasing |

## 🚀 5-Stage Crate Introduction

> Adapted from *Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy*, Chapter 3

1. **Open-door Buffet**  
   • Scatter 5–10 treats just inside the doorway.  
   • Let puppy **choose** to walk in/out. **No door closing** yet.
2. **Hand-Delivered Rewards**  
   • Toss a treat at the back; when pup goes in, **mark & feed** another treat through the bars.  
   • Repeat 5–6 times; end session before pup loses interest.
3. **Duration With Chew**  
   • Place a stuffed KONG in the crate.  
   • Once pup settles to chew, gently close the door **for 10–30 sec**, then open *before* whining starts.
4. **Door-Closed Breaks**  
   • Gradually increase closed-door time: 1 min → 3 min → 5 min.  
   • Sit nearby reading or working so pup isn't **alone & anxious**.
5. **Out-of-Sight Settling**  
   • Begin leaving the room or adding mild background noise.  
   • Build to 30–45 min nap windows (ideal for work calls).

💡 **Tip:** Always release **after a moment of calm**. Opening the door during barking teaches the *wrong* lesson.

## 🌙 Overnight Crate Routine

1. Last potty break at **bedtime (~11 pm)**.  
2. Crate beside your bed for Week 1; move gradually if desired.  
3. Plan a mid-night potty run (~3 am) for the first week, then **stretch by 15 min every 2 nights** as pup's bladder matures.  
4. Keep lights low & talk minimal—**business only**, then back to sleep.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQs

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Whining immediately | Shorten duration; release on silence, not noise. Add chew toy. |
| Refuses to enter | Reset to Stage 1 with higher-value treats. |
| Soils inside | Review potty schedule; pup was kept in too long. Sanitize thoroughly. |
| Chews bedding | Remove soft bedding temporarily; provide rubber chew instead. |
