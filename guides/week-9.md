## 🚫 Susan's Problem Prevention - Week 9

- **Reward spontaneous calm** behavior with surprise treats
- **"Quiet" cue conditioning**: Only say when barking naturally stops

### **Travel Anxiety Prevention:**
- **Carrier = never terminal**: In → treats → out → play continues
- **Car = positive**: Engine on → treats → engine off → more treats
- **Handling = choice**: Thunder can move away, gets treats for staying
