# Week 9 Training Schedule

*Building directly on the foundation laid during [Week 8]({{ "/puppy-schedule/" | relative_url }}), this week focuses on **expanding positive experiences** while maintaining the core crate → potty → play rhythm.*

---

## 🎯 Week Overview

- **Age:** 9 weeks old
- **Focus:** Confidence-building in & out of the home, continuing structured routine, gentle exposure to novel sights & sounds
- **Nanny Support:** Mon, Tue, Thu & Fri (following the same visit flow you established in Week 8)
- **Key Additions:** First social vet visit, Tuesday puppy-training class, incremental grooming & handling practice

---

## 📅 Day-by-Day Plan

| Day | Key Objectives | Notes |
|-----|----------------|-------|
| **Monday** | • Continue crate comfort, short name-game sessions.<br/>• Introduce Thunder – in his crate – to **2-3 calm adult dogs** at a safe distance. | Keep all introductions reward-based; release distance or block view at first sign of stress. |
| **Tuesday** | • Replicate Monday structure.<br/>• **Puppy Training Class #1** in the afternoon – bring very high-value treats & his travel carrier for safe rests. | Keep class upbeat & short; leave early if he shows overwhelm. |
| **Wednesday** | • Work-from-home day: extend pen time in your office for quiet exposure to keyboard/talk sounds.<br/>• Short carrier ride around the block. | Aim for a mid-day nap in the movable pen to proof settling in new spaces. |
| **Thursday** | • Repeat Wednesday structure, adding 1–2 new people greetings (treat toss technique). | Maintain loose-leash skills inside the house with 3–5 "follow" reps. |
| **Friday** | • First full nanny day. Review visit protocol & marker words with nanny.<br/>• Nanny to perform a **neighbourhood walk** past light traffic while Thunder rides in the carrier. | Provide written checklist for consistency. |
| **Weekend** | • **Social Vet Visit** (no procedures) – carrier ride, scale weight, exam-table treats.<br/>• 1-2 controlled social events with friends in a fenced yard or living room.<br/>• Begin **brush & nail-board** games for future grooming. | Keep total social time ≤ 20 min/event; finish every session with crate nap & chew. |

## 🎓 Training Focus Areas

### Name & Recall
- Reinforce rapid orientation to "Thunder!" with **Yes → treat**.<br/>- Play the **1-2-3 Game** (count to three, present treat) to condition sprinting back indoors.

### Crate & Carrier Confidence
- 2-hour calm-crate goal (with chew) by Friday.<br/>- Carrier sessions: 3–5 min stationary → 5 min indoor carry → 5 min outdoor carry.

### Foundational Obedience
- **Sit** on first cue 80 % of the time.<br/>- Introduce **Down** lured from sit (reward low between paws).<br/>- 5-second **Stay** with minimal body movement.

### Grooming Desensitisation
- Daily 30-second brush strokes + food scatter.
- Nail-board scratch game (sand-paper board) 2–3 reps.
