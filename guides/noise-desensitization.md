## 📋 Training Components

### Sound Desensitization

| **Phase**           | **Activity**                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intro**           | Play soft ambient audio (doorbells, traffic, kitchen sounds, children, barking) during meals/play. |
| **Build**           | Gradually increase sound volume across sessions; reward with calm engagement or food toys.        |
| **Realism**         | Stack sounds (e.g. city ambience + dogs + vacuum); introduce via daily background play.          |
| **Generalization**  | Play sound files in multiple environments (crate, playpen, kitchen, porch) to build neutrality.   |

**Goal:** Thunder remains calm and engaged during normal activities regardless of environmental sounds.
