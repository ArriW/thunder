# ⚡ Command Vocabulary & Marker Cues

A concise lookup table of every word Thunder hears in training. Following **Susan Garrett's philosophy**, keep sessions crystal-clear by using **one cue, one meaning** and **never repeating commands**.

> 🎯 **Susan's Rule**: "If you have to repeat a cue more than once, your dog is telling you it isn't a conditioned response yet."

## 🎯 Susan Garrett's Marker System

| Word | Type | When to Use | Susan's Method |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Yes** | Event Marker | The **exact moment** Thunder performs the desired behavior | Mark the instant behavior happens → treat immediately |
| **Good** | Duration Marker | While Thunder *maintains* the behavior | "Good...Good..." during stays, keeps behavior going |
| **Break** | Release Word | To end the current behavior & give permission to move | Clear release from any command - prevents frustration |

> 💡 **Key Principle**: Stick to these three words. Susan emphasizes that mixing markers confuses timing and weakens the conditioned response.

## 🐾 Core Obedience Cues (Susan's Approach)

| Cue | Behavior | Susan's Training Notes |
|-----|----------|------------------------|
| **Thunder** | Name Recognition | Should mean "look at me and await next cue" - never meaningless |
| **Sit** | Sit until released | Build with "Yes!" marker, maintain with "Good," release with "Break" |
| **Down** | Lie down until released | Introduce after 17 weeks when confidence is solid |
| **Touch** | Nose-target handler's hand | Perfect for redirecting attention and building engagement |
| **Come** | Recall to front position | **Most important cue** - always highest value reward |
| **Place** | Go to bed/mat & stay | Susan's "This Place Game" - makes location meaningful |
| **Crate** | Enter crate willingly | Condition as **positive** - crate = good things happen |

## 🚫 Susan's "Never Do" List

- **❌ Never repeat a cue** - If Thunder doesn't respond, the behavior isn't conditioned yet
- **❌ Never use the name meaninglessly** - Don't say "Thunder" constantly or it becomes background noise  
- **❌ Never use markers inconsistently** - "Yes" always means the same thing
- **❌ Never call Thunder for something unpleasant** - Name should always predict good things
- **❌ Never give a command you can't enforce** - Set Thunder up for success

## 🔄 Susan's Classical Conditioning Cues

| Cue | Purpose | Conditioning Method |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| **Potty** | Elimination command | Say while Thunder is going → "Yes!" → treat |
| **Get Busy** | Defecation command | Say during the act → build association |
| **Quiet** | Stop barking | Only say when barking stops → "Yes!" → treat |
| **Cookie** | Look for treats on ground | Say word → throw treat → builds floor search |

> 📘 **Susan's Philosophy**: These aren't traditional "commands" but **conditioned responses** - the word predicts what's about to happen.

## 🎲 Susan's 5 Games Integration

| Game | Associated Cues | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Training is Fun** | "Cookie" (treat toss) | Builds positive training associations |
| **Name Recognition** | "Thunder" | Makes name meaningful and valuable |
| **This Place** | "Place," "Break" | Creates location value and impulse control |
| **Permission** | "Break," "Cookie" | Teaches when movement is allowed |
| **Four on Floor** | (No verbal cue) | Automatic sit for attention/rewards |

## 🚀 How to Introduce a New Cue (Susan's Method)

1. **Get the behavior first** - Lure, capture, or shape the action
2. **Mark the instant it happens** - "Yes!" at the perfect moment
3. **Reward immediately** - High-value treat follows marker
4. **Repeat 5-10 times** - Build the pattern without the cue word
5. **Add the cue** - Say word → behavior happens → "Yes!" → treat
6. **Never repeat** - One cue, one response, always

> 🎯 **Susan's Success Tip**: "If your dog knows it, they'll do it on the first cue every time."

## 🔊 Cue Conditioning for Equipment

Following Susan's method of making everything "good":

| Equipment | Conditioning Cue | Method |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Collar** | (Visual cue) | Collar appears → "Yes!" → treat |
| **Leash** | (Visual cue) | Leash clips on → "Yes!" → treat → **remove leash** |
| **Brush** | "Brush" | Say word → show brush → "Yes!" → treat |
| **Car** | "Car" | Say word → approach car → "Yes!" → treat |

> 🔄 **Terminal Prevention**: Always end on a positive note and rehearse endings multiple times.

## 📊 Susan's Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Susan's Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| **Dog ignores cue** | Behavior isn't fully conditioned - go back to basics |
| **Dog does behavior before cue** | Good! Reward the offered behavior |
| **Slow response** | Increase reward value and enthusiasm |
| **Inconsistent response** | Check your timing and environment |
