# ⚡ Command Vocabulary & Marker Cues

A concise lookup table of every word Thunder hears in training. Keep sessions crystal-clear by using **one cue, one meaning**.

---
## 🎯 Marker Words
| Word | Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Yes** | Event Marker | The moment Thunder performs the desired behavior | Dog's nose touches hand → "Yes!" → treat |
| **Good** | Duration Marker | While Thunder *maintains* the behavior | Dog stays in a sit → "Good...Good..." |
| **Okay** | Release Word | To end the current behavior & release Thunder | After a stay → "Okay!" → free play |

> 💡 Stick to these three words. Mixing markers confuses timing and weakens learning.

## 🐾 Core Obedience Cues
| Cue | Behavior | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Thunder** | Name Recognition | Look at handler & await next cue |
| **Sit** | Sit until released | Pair with duration marker "Good" |
| **Down** | Lie down until released | Introduce in Week 17–24 |
| **Touch** | Nose-target handler's hand | Great for redirecting focus |
| **Come** | Recall to front position | Always high-value reward |
| **Place** (optional) | Go to bed/mat & stay | Useful in busy environments |

## 🚀 How to Introduce a New Cue
1. Lure or capture the behavior.
2. The instant it happens, **mark "Yes"**.
3. Reward. Repeat 3-5×.
4. Once predictable, say the cue *before* the behavior.
5. Fade lures and add duration with **"Good."**
