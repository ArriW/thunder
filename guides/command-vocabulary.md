# üó£Ô∏è Command Vocabulary

A concise reference for every verbal cue Thunder is expected to understand. Keep pronunciation and context consistent to avoid confusion.

| Cue | Category | Purpose / When to Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Thunder** | Name / Attention | Gain the puppy's focus before issuing a command | Pair with eye-contact reward early on |
| **Sit** | Basic Obedience | Put rear on the ground, remain until released | Foundation behavior for polite greetings |
| **Stay** | Impulse Control | Maintain current position until released | Build duration & distractions gradually |
| **Come** | Recall | Return to handler promptly | Always reward generously, never punish after cue |
| **Touch** | Targeting | Nose-tap hand or target object | Great for redirection and engagement |
| **Focus** | Focus | Make eye contact with handler | Builds engagement; replaces "look" command |
| **Quiet** | Bark Control | Stop barking / vocalizing | Capture silence first, then add cue |
| **Crate** | Den Entry | Enter crate and remain calmly | Same cue for carrier if you prefer |
| **Potty** | Elimination | Eliminate in designated area | Say once, stand still while dog chooses spot |

## Marker Words (Timing & Release)

| Word | Type | Usage Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Yes** (or click) | Marker | Immediate reinforcement for correct behavior; choose either spoken "yes" or clicker, not both in the same session |
| **Good** | Secondary Marker / Praise | Soft confirmation during longer behaviors; precedes eventual "yes" + reward |
| **Okay** | Release | Signals the dog is free from the previous cue; avoid casual use in conversation |

*Total command cues: 9. Use these exact words across all guides to keep Thunder's vocabulary consistent.*
