## 4️⃣ Key Training Principles _(Steven Mann distilled)_
1. **Confidence first** – set the puppy up to win every interaction.  
2. **Reinforce the good** – mark & treat wanted behaviour, ignore/redirect the rest.  
3. **Short, fun sessions** – 3-5 minutes, several times a day.  
4. **Consistency** – same cues, same rewards, same rules from every caregiver.  
5. **Choice & Consent** – allow the puppy to opt-in; never force handling.

### You (Primary Guardian)
• Follow full schedule evenings & weekends.
